# Erasmus Computer Engineering Repository

This repository contains all the coursework, exercises, and projects I completed during my **Erasmus studies in Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda**.  
It is organized by course, with each folder including code, notes, and related documentation.  

## Repository Structure
- [`IntroductionToProgramming`](./IntroductionToProgramming)  
  Basics of programming: variables, control structures, functions, and arrays.  

- [`AlgorithmAndDataStructure`](./AlgorithmAndDataStructure)  
  Implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting algorithms.  

- [`InternetTechnologies`](./InternetTechnologies)  
  Web development concepts including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, client-server model, and small web projects.  

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A record of my learning journey during Erasmus.  
- A reference for future projects and studies.  
- A way to share knowledge and resources with others in Computer Engineering.  

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of interest.  
2. Each folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed information about topics covered and how to run the code.  
3. Clone this repository to experiment with the examples:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WinneRose/erasmus-ipg.git
