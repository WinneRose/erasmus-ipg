# Algorithm and Data Structure

This folder includes my implementations and practice files for the **Algorithm and Data Structure** course.

## Topics Covered
- Complexity analysis (Big-O notation)  
- Recursion and iterative solutions  
- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues  
- Trees and binary search trees  
- Sorting and searching algorithms  
- Graphs (basics)  

## Structure
Assignments and examples are grouped by topic. Each file demonstrates a particular algorithm or data structure.

## How to Run
1. Open the desired file in your IDE.
2. Compile and run.
3. Some examples include test cases to demonstrate correctness.
